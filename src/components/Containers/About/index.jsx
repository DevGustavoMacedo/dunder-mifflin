      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <p>
        As stated by the founder Robert Dunder, the company was founded in 1949, and it was a
        supplier of metal brackets for construction. Dunder Mifflin Inc. (stock symbol DMI) is a
        mid-cap regional paper and office supply distributor with an emphasis on servicing
        small-business clients. With a corporate office in New York City, Dunder Mifflin has
        branches in Akron, Ohio; Nashua, New Hampshire; Rochester, New York; Scranton, Pennsylvania;
        Syracuse, New York; and Utica, New York
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        For years, Dunder Mifflin was a paper company that was unable to compete with modern chains
        such as Staples and Office Depot. The company still used calls rather than the Internet,
        causing most customers to leave for the nation-wide chains, and is unable to adapt to an
        increasingly paperless world. Ryan Howard, a new employee of the Scranton branch, predicts
        the company will be obsolete by 2017. In 2007, Ryan Howard became Vice President of Sales
        and begins a massive restructuring of the entire company, including a new website that would
        help make sales more efficient. However, his website was a failure (due to an ill-advised
        social networking feature) and he is later arrested for fraud when it is discovered that he
        is double-counting sales transactions into the website that were already made by salesmen
        over the phone.
